# Lab: Setting Up Your GenAI Engineering Environment

## Phase 1: Secure Authentication
Follow these steps to access the API without leaving a trace on this shared PC.

- Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox) in **Guest Mode** or an **Incognito/Private Window**.
- Navigate to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
- Sign in using your Google Account.
- **Mobile Check:** Use your phone to approve the 2FA prompt or enter the code sent to your device.
- Accept the Terms of Service to enter the Google AI Studio dashboard.

## Phase 2: Generating Your API Key
Your API key is the "password" that allows your code to talk to the Gemini models.

- Click on **Get API key** in the top left sidebar.
- Select **Create API key in new project**.
- Copy the generated key (it starts with `AIza`).
- **Important:** Do not share this key with anyone or paste it into a public text file.

## Phase 4: Initializing the API in Colab
Once the notebook opens, run the first code cell to securely "inject" your key into the session.

- Paste your key into the pop-up box that appears.
- The `getpass` function ensures your key is hidden while you type.
